# Food Nutrition Analyzer  

A responsive web application designed to help users analyze and track food nutrition through the power of AI and real-time data. This project integrates machine learning, image recognition, and API-driven nutritional data to deliver personalized dietary recommendations.  

## Key Features  
- **Responsive Web Application**: Built with React.js and Tailwind CSS for a seamless user experience across devices.  
- **Image Recognition with CNN**: Utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to identify food items from user-uploaded images.  
- **Nutrition Data Integration**: Leverages a nutrition API to fetch comprehensive nutritional information based on the identified food item.  
- **Customized Health Advice**: Provides tailored recommendations on food consumption suitability, considering the user's age group (toddler to adult) and portion sizes.  
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simplifies interaction and visualization of nutrition details for better decision-making.  

## Technical Highlights  
- **Frontend**: Developed using React.js and styled with Tailwind CSS to ensure an intuitive and responsive user interface.  
- **Backend**: Integrated with APIs to enable real-time data retrieval and processing for accurate nutrition insights.  
- **Machine Learning**: Implements a CNN model to efficiently identify food items from images, bridging AI with practical health applications.  

## How It Works  
1. Upload an image of the food item.  
2. The application identifies the food item using the CNN model.  
3. Nutrition data is retrieved from the integrated API.  
4. Users receive personalized dietary recommendations based on the analysis.
